# GettingAndCleaningData
This is part of the data science course in Coursera.
In the other files of this repository you can find the exercises. This includes the run_analysis.R skript which fulfilles the following tasks. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

The tidy_data.R creates an independent data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The CodeBook.md describes all variables and their means as well as the data and transformations that have been made.
